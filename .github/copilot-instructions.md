# p5.js Mathematical Animation Project

This is a p5.js project focused on creating animated shapes using mathematical functions, particularly trigonometric functions like sine and cosine.

## Key Project Characteristics:
- Uses p5.js library for creative coding and animation
- Implements mathematical formulas for shape generation
- Features interactive controls and real-time animation
- Emphasizes organic, flowing shapes created through mathematical functions
- Includes placeholder sections for experimenting with different formulas

## Code Style Guidelines:
- Use clear, descriptive variable names for mathematical parameters
- Include comments explaining mathematical concepts and formulas
- Provide placeholder sections for easy formula experimentation
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
- Use HSB color mode for better color control in animations

## Mathematical Focus Areas:
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Polar to cartesian coordinate conversion
- Harmonic oscillations and wave patterns
- Time-based animation parameters
- Parametric equations for shape generation

When suggesting code improvements or new features:
- Focus on mathematical accuracy and visual appeal
- Provide multiple formula alternatives for shape generation
- Explain the mathematical concepts behind the code
- Suggest interactive parameters for real-time experimentation
